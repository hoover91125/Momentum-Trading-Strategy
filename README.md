# Momentum-Trading-Strategy
In this study, I demonstrate the application of the Momentum Trading Strategy on the components of the Dow Jones Index.
The analysis involves selecting the top-performing 10 stocks based on their annual return.
An equally weighted portfolio is then formed by holding these 10 stocks for the subsequent year.
This process is repeated from 2010 to 2020, allowing us to calculate the annual returns of the portfolio.
Finally, the effectiveness of the strategy is evaluated by comparing the portfolio return to the return of the index itself.
